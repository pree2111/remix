Myntra Remix is team **TLS Handshake's** prototype submission for **Myntra Hackerramp WeForShe 2024**.
### About

Using an **algorithm which calculates the carbon footprint**, it also tells them how much they're contributing to a sustainable future by shopping second-hand items. Myntra Remix also provides **personalised recommendations** for the remix items.
